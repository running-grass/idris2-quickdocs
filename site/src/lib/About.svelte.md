Idris2 Documentation Browser
============================

This page is a search engine for Idris 2 libraries. You can think of it as Hoogle of a poorer quality, but for Idris. Only packages curated by [Pack](https://github.com/stefan-hoeck/idris2-pack/) (a package manager for Idris) are indexed.

Usage
-----

Use the search field on the left to perform a search, results will update as you type.

You can press <kbd>/</kbd> anywhere on the page to focus the search field.

### Fuzzy Search Patterns

You can use dots to quickly skip over namespaces, e.g. enter `C.M.S.run` to find `Control.Monad.State.runState`
